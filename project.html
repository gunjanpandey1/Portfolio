		    	<h4>ONLINE PYTHON INTERPRETER</h4>
		    	<p>I've developed a web-based projectâ€”an online Python interpreter. Users can input Python code directly into the browser and see the output in real-time. Additionally, the interpreter supports various Python libraries and syntax highlighting for ease of use.<br></br>
You can explore the project's source code by clicking <a href='https://github.com/gunjanpandey1/Python-interpreter'>here</a> and learn more about it.</p>

		    	<h4>AQI PREDICTION</h4>
		    	<p>I've collaborated on a team project focused on predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning methods. Our project aims to forecast AQI levels based on various environmental factors such as particulate matter, humidity, and temperature.<br></br>
